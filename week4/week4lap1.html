        <h2 id="internet">Internet</h2>
        <P>The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses 
            the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network 
            of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to 
            global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The 
            Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext
            documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.The 
            Internet enables the exchange of information and data across the globe, allowing individuals, organizations, 
            and governments to access a wide range of resources, such as websites, email, file sharing, online gaming, and
            video streaming. It has become an essential part of modern life, transforming the way we communicate, work, 
            learn, and access information.

            The Internet is made up of a vast number of interconnected networks, including private, public, academic, 
            business, and government networks. These networks are connected through various wired and wireless technologies, 
            such as fiber-optic cables, satellite links, and wireless routers. The Internet is decentralized, meaning that 
            no single entity or organization controls it. Instead, it is governed by a collaborative effort involving numerous 
            organizations, standards bodies, and stakeholders.
            
            It's important to note that the Internet is different from the World Wide Web (WWW). The World Wide Web is a 
            collection of interconnected documents and other resources, accessible via the Internet, that are formatted in 
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and can be viewed with a web browser. The web is just one of the many services 
            available on the Internet, albeit a widely used one.</P>

        <h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
        <p>The present page holds the title of a primary topic, and an article needs to be written about it. 
            It is believed to qualify as a broad-concept article. It may be written directly at this page or 
            drafted elsewhere and then moved over here. Related titles should be described in Layout, while 
            unrelated titles should be moved to Layout (disambiguation). In the context of design and visual 
            presentation, "layout" refers to the arrangement and organization of elements, such as text, images, 
            and other graphical components, on a page or screen. It involves determining the positioning, size,
             alignment, and spatial relationships between these elements to create a visually appealing and effective composition.

            Layout is an important aspect of graphic design, web design, print media, and user interface (UI) 
            design. It helps to structure content and guide the viewer's eye through the information presented. 
            A well-designed layout considers factors such as hierarchy, balance, contrast, proximity, and white 
            space to enhance readability, usability, and visual impact.
            
            In print media, layout refers to the design of pages in magazines, newspapers, brochures, or other 
            printed materials. It involves arranging headlines, body text, images, captions, and other elements
             in a harmonious and logical manner, taking into account factors such as readability, coherence, and aesthetic appeal.
            
            In web design and UI design, layout refers to the arrangement of elements on a web page or screen 
            interface. It includes the positioning of navigation menus, headers, content sections, sidebars, 
            and footers to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience. Responsive layout design is also 
            important to ensure that the content adapts and displays appropriately on different devices and screen sizes.
            
            Overall, layout plays a crucial role in visual communication, helping to organize and present 
            information in a way that is visually pleasing, effective, and easy to understand.</p>

        <h2 id="linearlayout">Linear layout</h2>
        <p>LinearLayout is a layout manager in Android that arranges its child views in a single direction,
            either horizontally or vertically. It is commonly used to create user interfaces in Android applications.
            In the context of user interface (UI) design and mobile app development, a "Linear Layout" refers to a 
            type of layout manager that arranges UI elements in a linear, sequential manner. It is commonly used in Android app development.

            In a linear layout, UI elements are organized either horizontally or vertically, one after the other, 
            in a linear fashion. Each element takes up the necessary space based on its content or specified dimensions. 
            The elements can be aligned to the start, end, or center of the layout.
            
            Linear layouts offer simplicity and flexibility in arranging UI components. They can be nested within 
            each other to create more complex UI structures. Some common use cases for linear layouts include creating 
            lists, forms, toolbars, and other linearly structured UI elements.
            
            In Android development, linear layouts are created using the LinearLayout class. Developers can define 
            the orientation (horizontal or vertical) of the linear layout and specify various attributes such as 
            gravity, weight, and padding to control the positioning and behavior of the UI elements within the layout.
            
            It's worth noting that while linear layouts are useful for straightforward linear arrangements, 
            more complex and flexible layouts can be achieved using other layout managers such as RelativeLayout, 
            ConstraintLayout, or GridLayout, depending on the specific requirements of the UI design.</p>

        <h2 id="pathname">Pathname</h2>
        <p>A pathname is a string that represents the location or path of a file or directory in a file system. It is used 
            to uniquely identify the location of a file or directory within the file system hierarchy.A "pathname" is a string 
            that represents the location or path of a file or directory within a file system. It is used to uniquely identify 
            the location of a specific file or directory in a hierarchical file system structure.

            In most operating systems, a pathname consists of a series of directory names separated by a delimiter, 
            such as a forward slash (/) or a backslash (). The root directory is typically represented at the beginning 
            of the pathname, followed by subsequent directories and the filename if applicable.In this example, / represents 
            the root directory, followed by the home directory, then the user directory, and so on, until we reach the example.
            txt file within the Documents directory.

            Pathnames can also include special symbols to represent certain locations or operations. For instance, . 
            represents the current directory, and .. represents the parent directory.
            
            In addition to representing file and directory locations, pathnames can also include additional 
            information such as file extensions, permissions, or other attributes depending on the file system and operating system.</p>
